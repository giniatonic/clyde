Code for Clyde the grumpy robot!

clyde8.py is the most recent iteration of the Clyde's brain. Clyde uses 3 threads to measure distances with ultrasonic sensors. He then creates an instance of the Robot class in Robot.py. There are then 8 states that Clyde can be in based on a threshold distance for each of the sensors.
